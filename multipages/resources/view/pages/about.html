  <h4>Why You Need a Strong "About Us" Page</h4>
  <p>When a potential client or customer ends up on your site and likes what they see, they'll likely  head to your "About Us" page. These visitors are essentially searching for your storyâ€”who are you, and what do you offer? This is your opportunity to shine and build a connection between you and your new visitor. Although you may be 100% business-oriented, your About Us page is your chance to connect on a human level. A great About Us page can help your brand:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>    
    <li>Make a good first impression on new site visitors</li>
    <li>Communicate the story, cause, and purpose of your business</li>
    <li>Differentiate you in a positive way from your competition</li>
    <li>Put a more personable face to your brand</li>
    <li>Establish trust that your business is legitimate</li>
    <li>Give customers a reason to purchase from you</li>
    <li>Build loyalty, keeping customers coming back for more</li>
    <br>
    <p>At the end of the day, your About Us page is essentially a sales page. Based on the story you tell, you will paint a picture that represents who you are as a brand. WHY would a potential client or customer want to buy from you? Put a face to the name, bridging the gap between you and your audience.</p>
  </ul>
